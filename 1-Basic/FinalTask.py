Final Beginner Task:
    Take the users input to get four numbers
    Print out the 4 numbers the user entered in one line, 
        with a sentence to remind them what they entered
    Then calculate the average, sum, and product of these numbers,
        and print out these values with an 'fstring'

Example:

Enter your 4 numbers
Number 1: 8
Number 2: 12
Number 3: 3
Number 4: 19

You entered: 8 12 3 19
